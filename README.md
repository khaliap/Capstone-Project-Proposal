# Capstone Project Proposal

This exercise is designed to help you narrow the scope of your research down to a well-defined problem whose solution you can reasonably derive over the course of the next five to six weeks. 


## Project Team
* Liam
* Jarae
* Khalia
  
## Research Area(s)
* Kaboom
* React
* Postgres
* Socket io 
* Ready Player Me
* Colyseus
* MUI

## Problem Statement
>_If you are ever feeling lonely or bored our game can change that. It is a high-paced action game that you need to be strategic about.  It also is a multiplayer game with text chat and voice chat so you can talk to your friends while you play the game. This game is easily accessible since all you need to do is to search the game on the web put in your email and a password then play. 

## Proposed Solution
> _Our game is based on hot potato, it is a 4-player game, 1 random player has a potato at the beginning of the round and has to pass it before the timer goes out. All throughout the map, there are power-ups for both the players without the potato and with it. Those power-ups are speed, shield, and double jump. There will be 3 different maps to choose from and each power-up image will change with the map theme. 

## Anticipated Technical Challenges
* Character frame movements
* Connecting multiple players together on one sever and allowing them to see the same thing at the same time 
* Voice chat feature that allows users to talk on the mic while playing the game
